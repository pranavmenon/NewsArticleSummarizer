	WAUKEE, Iowa President Barack Obama has praised Hillary Clinton's political experience, a boost to her campaign as she battles an insurgent Bernie Sanders a week before the Democratic presidential nominating process kicks off.
	While never explicitly criticizing Sanders, a senator from Vermont whose campaign is focused on pledges to redress social inequality and contain Wall Street excesses, Obama praised Clinton's experience and suggested several times that Clinton's messages are grounded in realism. 
	Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, agreed they are not the same, but still pointed to a similar crowd response and said Sanders enjoys a similar momentum.

	In less than one month, Edward Snowden, the infamous NSA whistleblower responsible for ratting out the U.S. government's Orwellian spying programs, will be addressing Liberty Forum, an annual conference held by the Free State Project, an initiative to move 20,000 hardcore libertarians to New Hampshire to build the free society of tomorrow.
	Aaron Swartz pioneered many tech projects supporting the free flow of information online, culminating with the downloading of millions of restricted journal articles with the intent of making them available for free.
	Snowden isn't using his successful escape to just hang out and not be in prison.

	Last month ABC News reported that U.S. intelligence suspected ISIS had acquired thousands of blank Syrian passports and at least one passport printing machine after taking over government offices in Syria.
	"Since more than 17 months [have] passed since Raqqa and Deir ez-Zour fell to ISIS, it is possible that individuals from Syria with passports 'issued' in these ISIS-controlled cities or who had passport blanks, may have traveled to the U.S.," the HSI report says.
	"The source stated fake Syrian passports can be obtained in Syria for $200 to $400 and that backdated passport stamps to be placed in the passport cost the same."

	Which happened in May of 2014, initially went unreported by the US Air Force even as a team of experts reviewed the service's nuclear forces in the wake of a testing scandal and security failures.
	According to the Air Force, the missile was partially damaged in this troubleshooting process because the maintenance chief "Did not correctly adhere to technical guidance" and "Lacked the necessary proficiency level" to understand that what was being done to find the problem could cause greater damage to the missile.
	While expensive, the May 2014 incident at the "Juliet-07" silo-nine miles outside Peetz, Colorado-is hardly the most serious incident to have occurred within the Air Force's nuclear forces.

	The Swedish home affairs minister, Anders Ygeman, said of Greece: "If a country doesn't live up to its obligations, we will have to restrict its connections to the Schengen area."
	About 35,000 have made the sea crossing from Turkey to Greece since the beginning of the year, a 20-fold increase on the same period last year.
	Following Austria's announcement of immigration curbs, countries on the Balkan route between Greece and Austria have followed suit, meaning that hundreds of thousands could end being kettled up in Greece unless there is an EU policy breakthrough.
